## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.3] — 2026-06-07

Condensed onboarding and version-aware permission setup.

### Added

- Two-page onboarding: Intro (welcome + how it works + privacy) → Permissions → Get started.
- `PermissionSetupRow` with brief why-rationale under each permission chip.
- Live **Allow restricted settings** chip when sideloaded (API 33+); replaces separate setup card.
- `SettingsGuideProvider` with API/OEM-aware intent chains and numbered manual steps when Settings cannot open directly.
- `PermissionStepsDialog` with Open Settings retry and generic installer workaround (session install).

### Fixed

- OnePlus/OxygenOS: restricted-settings chip now turns green when Notification or Usage access is granted, even if AppOps stays at `default`.
- OnePlus restricted-settings instructions: use system **Restricted setting** dialog **Allow** first, then App info ⋮ fallback.

### Changed

- Removed Verify onboarding page; Permissions is the final step.
- Alert notifications row hidden below API 33.
- Settings → Permissions uses short rationale; shared settings navigator across onboarding and settings.

### Removed

- `RestrictedSetupCard` (replaced by restricted-settings permission chip + steps dialog).

## [1.2.2] — 2026-06-07

Guided sideload permission setup for Android 13+.

### Added

- Detect sideloaded installs and restricted-settings lock; `RestrictedSetupCard` with step-by-step unlock flow.
- Opens App info for **Allow restricted settings** (⋮ menu); OnePlus SAI fallback instructions.
- Live permission status on onboarding Permissions page (refreshes on return from Settings without advancing pager).
- `usePermissionStatuses()` hook shared across onboarding, Permissions screen, and home banner.

### Fixed

- Onboarding Permissions page no longer freezes permission chip state until Verify page.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-07

Signed GitHub release fix.

### Fixed

- GitHub release APK is now **signed** (`Screen-Wakelock-Detector-{version}.apk`); unsigned v1.2.0 artifact failed to launch on some devices (e.g. OnePlus 13).

### Added

- Release signing: `keystore.properties` / CI secrets, `scripts/release/build-signed-apk.sh`, `verify-signed-apk.sh`, `m9_smoke.sh`.
- `republish-release.yml` workflow_dispatch for re-uploading signed assets.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-07

M8 release hardening and intelligence.

### Added

- High-contrast adaptive launcher icon (phone + amber screen glow + notification dot).
- App ignore list; custom quiet hours UI; reason-code History filter chips; permission health score on Home.
- Retention policy with daily WorkManager prune; date-range CSV/JSON export sheet; short-wake filter.
- Detail similar wakes section; full-screen intent banner on Detail.
- Week-over-week comparison stat on Insights.
- Per-app nightly wake budgets with alert when exceeded.
- Recurring pattern cards: Mute channel and Open settings actions.
- Batch mute from Insights top-offender menu with OEM fallback messaging.
- Wake count Glance widget: tonight's count + top offender.
- Root parser footnote on Detail when root-enhanced; root timeline for same package.
- Root diagnostic text export via share intent — no message bodies.
- Monitoring pause schedule respected by WakeMonitorService; QS tile shows schedule pause.
- Local JSON backup/restore via SAF (export + import with confirmation).
- Tablet Insights two-column layout at width ≥840dp.
- `scripts/release/verify-release-apk.sh` and `scripts/smoke/m8_smoke.sh`.

### Changed

- Release builds: R8 resource shrinking (`isShrinkResources`); CI verifies minified APK before publish.
- Replaced `material-icons-extended` with `material-icons-core`.
- `RootAttributor` exposes `parserId` on snapshots; stored on wake events as `rootParserId`.
- Version 1.2.0 / versionCode 1002000.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-07
