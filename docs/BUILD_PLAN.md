# Build Plan

Active tasks only. Completed items move to [`COMPLETED.md`](COMPLETED.md) via `scripts/archive-completed-tasks.py` **after** milestone smoke PASS is recorded in [`GATES.md`](GATES.md).

**Labels:** `[AGENT]` = implement autonomously · `[ADB]` = needs USB device · `[HUMAN]` = defer to milestone-end checklist · `[PARALLEL-OK]` = safe in same `<!-- PARALLEL -->` block

---

## Remaining work (HUMAN only)

- [ ] [HUMAN] GitLab project, MCP, README About, labels (`scripts/gitlab/create-labels.sh` ready)
- [ ] [HUMAN] M2/M4/M5 copy and design walkthroughs (ONBOARDING.md, DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)
- [ ] [HUMAN] 1.0.0-rc.1 soak; F-Droid first inclusion + `FDROIDDATA_FORK_URL` secret
- [ ] [HUMAN] Tag triggers live fdroiddata MR; app on F-Droid after merge
- [ ] [HUMAN] M8 icon legibility on device launcher — round/square masks, light/dark wallpapers

**M8:** Complete — tag [v1.2.0](https://github.com/edwardlthompson/screen-wakelock-detector/releases/tag/v1.2.0) published 2026-06-07.
